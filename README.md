# SystemAnalysisDesign
DriverPass wanted an application that could expand its reach and offer packages for those looking to "study" for their driving test with the DMV.
This application should make it easy for customers to buy, schedule, and track the progress of testing.
The client is DriverPass.
The system should be able to offer driver training services such as online classes, practice tests, and over-the-road training. The system should also be able to manage reservations, assign user roles, be secure, and update based on DMV requirements guidance.
I felt I articulated the needs of the system very well but not necessarily putting it all in diagrams. Particularly, the UML Class diagram, I feel I can simplify it better.
I feel I captured all the users needs. This is important ensure the client is happy with the end product. Less time changing aspects of code is more efficient time getting the client what they need.
I approached designing software from the bigger picture down to smaller chunks. It is not easy to keep a picture so big, it is beneficial to bullet it out to help you along the way.
